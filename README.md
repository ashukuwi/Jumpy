# Jumpy
Jumpy is a game that uses the pygame module and runs in python 3. 
You play as a rabbit trying to get as high as possible by jumping from platform to platform,
collecting powerups, and dodging enemies. When the game starts, you can press different keys to 
play on different difficulties. The difficulty changes the friction of the platforms and the score multiplier.
Your high score is saved in a .txt file and is displayed in the game.

To run, make sure you have the pygame and numpy python modules installed, as well as python. Download all files
and place all the assets in the assets folder into the same directory as the three python files.
